# Wemos D1 Mini Email Filament Sensor

Simple as a button that when released will send an email to the owner of the 3D printer that their printer has run out of filament. Project requested by Tekbots at Oregon State University for their Lulzbot TAZ 6 3D printers. However, this design sits in-line with any filament and functions all the same.

Using the Wemos Filament Sensor is super easy.
1. Connect to the Wemos Access Point via your network connections. Looks for the __SSID: WemosFilamentSensor__ and use the __Password: wem0sfun!__.

2. Once connected open a web browser and enter __192.168.4.1__ into the address bar. You will be directed to the Wemos Initialization Form.

3. Fill out the form! Be sure to get all of this info correct (if you submit incorrect information you will need to reset the device). If you are using a Gmail account for the sender account it will need the less secure app option https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps?pli=1. If this account does not send an email every other week or so it will disable 3rd party applications.

4. Upon submitting you should be disconnected and the access point will disappear. The Wemos Filament Sensor is connected to the WiFi and will now send the email you specified whenever the filament button is released (after being depressed).
