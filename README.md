# email_filament_sensor
Simple as a button that when released will send an email to the owner of the 3D printer that their printer has run out of filament. Project requested by Tekbots at Oregon State University for their Lulzbot TAZ 6 3D printers. However, this design sits in-line with any filament and functions all the same.
